/* This is somewhat complicated to do conditional compilation for '@UIApplicationMain' to disapear for NUXKit builds.
 So for now, a main.swift as to be created with:
 
 `exit(UIApplicationMain(0,nil , nil, APP_DELEGATE_CLASS_NAME))`
 
 note : APP_DELEGATE_CLASS_NAME must be something like ModuleName.AppDelegate , ModuleName being the name of the module/app.
